    <!-- You are helping with a basic user comment system for a website.
      Your task is to write JavaScript code that does the following:
Check if a user comment contains any digits (like ages, amounts, or phone numbers).
If digits are found, replace them with the word "NUMBER" (case-insensitive and for all matches).
Return both:
Whether a number was found (true/false)
The updated comment with numbers replaced
Test the code using this comment:
 "My son is 12 years old. Our flat number is 45 and contact is 9876543210." -->

<body>
  <p id="demo"></p>

      var str = "My son is 12 years old. Our flat number is 45 and contact is 9876543210.";
     console.log("whether a number was found = " + /\d/.test(str));
      var num = str.replace(/[0-9]+/gi,"NUMBER");   
      // var num = str.replace(/\d+/g, "NUMBER");
      console.log(num);
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = num;
